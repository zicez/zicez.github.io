A human powered carousel. 

#### What and Why
Along with two of my friends, we designed and built this carousel ride. This project is my biggest project so far. I have never designed anything human sized before. To be honest, I was a little nervous about this process because people can get hurt. However, I worked along with very capable friends who gave me a lot of advices.

For our school’s Residence Exploration Period , we built a swinging carousel ride. Our goal was to create a safe and fun ride that will attract people to come live at our dormitory (freshman get to chose what dorm they want to live in after exploring all the dorms). The ride is human powered (two people walk around the platform and push) and can seat up to four riders. The seats are attached 7.5 feet from the center, but the riders spin out farther as #Yolo spins due to centrifugal force.

### The Design
The ride is broken into 3 main parts:

1. A base stand with a large pipe sticking out of it.
2. A platform that people can run on to push the carousel.
3. A rotating top that contains the swings that people sit on.

The purpose of the base stand is to prevent the pipe from tipping over during operation or when the riders are getting on or off. Ideally, people of close to the same weight would sit opposite each other on the ride to prevent huge imbalances and torques. We realized that it wouldn’t always be loaded in perfectly ideal conditions, so we designed it to be able to withstand a 250lb-f difference in load at 1 rotation/4 seconds.

The base consists of 4 main 4x4 spokes and 8 sets of diagonal braces (one large and one small diagonal brace on each side). We had to balance size and strength constraints when designing the diagonals. The bigger the diagonals, the stronger the base. However, if we made them too big they would either hit each other or the base platform. We decided to use 2 of each of the following diagonal braces:￼

Each brace is made of 2 2x6 pieces of wood screwed together. The spokes are each 8ft 4x4s (We chose that length because that was the cheapest length that would be long enough to make the spokes).
