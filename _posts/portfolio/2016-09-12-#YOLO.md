A human powered carousel. 

#### What and Why
Along with two of my friends, we designed and built this carousel ride. This project is my biggest project so far. I have never designed anything human sized before. To be honest, I was a little nervous about this process because people can get hurt. However, I worked along with very capable friends who gave me a lot of advices.

For our school’s Residence Exploration Period , we built a swinging carousel ride. Our goal was to create a safe and fun ride that will attract people to come live at our dormitory (freshman get to chose what dorm they want to live in after exploring all the dorms). The ride is human powered (two people walk around the platform and push) and can seat up to four riders. The seats are attached 7.5 feet from the center, but the riders spin out farther as #Yolo spins due to centrifugal force.

### The Design
The ride is broken into 3 main parts:

1. A base stand with a large pipe sticking out of it.
..*The purpose of the base stand is to prevent the pipe from tipping over during operation or when the riders are getting on or off. Ideally, people of close to the same weight would sit opposite each other on the ride to prevent huge imbalances and torques. We realized that it wouldn’t always be loaded in perfectly ideal conditions, so we designed it to be able to withstand a 250lb-f difference in load at 1 rotation/4 seconds.
2. A platform that people can run on to push the carousel.
3. A rotating top that contains the swings that people sit on. This rotating top sits on top of the large pipe sticking out of the base stand. 

### Some Math
In the design, there are two big failure modes. They are all related to the central metal post. The buckling of the central post due to human load.  The bending of the central post due to uneven loading. 

```Python
#Define constraints for column calculation
E = 29e6; %PSI
F = 1000; %Pound
SF = 2; %safety factor
K = 1; %Column effective length factor
L = 3*12; %inch. Unsupported length

#Calculating for buckling failure
#Using a known column radius, solve thickness
R = 1.5
t = F*SF*(K*L)^2/(pi^2*E*pi*R^3)
```
To support our load, the central metal pipe has to be at least 8.5411e-04 inch, which is not very much. We ended up ordering a ~1/8 inch thick metal pipe, so it is extremely solid.

 ```Python
#Calculating for bending of central post due to uneven loading.
F1 = 400 # lb. Uneven Loading by one person
L1 = 72 # inch. Length of beam on top.

maxStress = (F1*L1*R)/pi*R^3*t; 
#maxStress should be less than 1800 psi
```
The max stress on the column should be less than 1800 psi. In this uneven loading scenario of 400lb, the stress is only 39.6389 PSI, much less than max possible value.
