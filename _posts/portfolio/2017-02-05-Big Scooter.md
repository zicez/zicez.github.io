Building an electric scooter

#### Design
Since coming to MIT, I have always wanted to build an electric scooter. All the cool kids seem to have one, and it would be a really convient way to get around campus. I decided to build one with a couple of friends. We wanted to do something different and not just rehashed the same design.

The frame is made out of scrap pieces of metal pipes, 8020 aluminum, and waterjetted aluminum plate. 

In our scooter, we wanted to ride the vehicle both standing up and sitting down. To do this, we made the handle bar really high - think Ape Hangers of a motorcycle. This means we can sit on the scooter and reach up onto the handle bar, or comfortable stand on the scooter and can still comfortably reach.


The scooter has a rear suspension system. The back wheel is placed on a separate pivot joint

The installed electric motor is rated for 2kW. The motor drives the back wheel through a chain and sprocket system. After riding the scooter for a while, we noticed that the scooter will forcibly slow down if you let go on the throttle. To solve this problem, we added a freewheel on the hub of the motor.

#### In Action
I unfortunately did not collect any video of the fully working robot. Here are two videos of the robot partially working.
