Converting my acoustic violin into an electric violin. 

#### High Level Design
There are a couple of different methods to convert an acoustic instrument to an electric instrument. For this project, I built an magnetic pickup. This is the same technology that enabled the electric guitar. 

The magnetic pickup is composed of a magnet and a coil. The pickup is placed underneath the strings of a violin. Itâ€™s important to make sure that the strings are magnetically permeable i.e. steel and not gut core. As the string vibrates to make sound, a small current is induced in the string as it moves in the magnetic field of the magnet. The small induced current generates its own magnetic field. This generated field produces a voltage in the coil. As the string moves to make sound, a copy of that movement is generated as a changing voltage within the coil.

#### Building the pickup
The frame of the pickup is made from laser cut acrylic and steel standoff.
