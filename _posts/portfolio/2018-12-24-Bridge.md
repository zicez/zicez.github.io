A 60 feet long and 24 feet tall arch bridge.

#### What and Why
At the beginning of every school year, MIT dorm East Campus builds crazy structures to attract residents to live at our dorm. We have previously built roller coaster, giant forts, carousel, and etc. You can see videos of our previous years by searching "East Campus i3 Videos" on YouTube. This year I led a team of four people to construct a 60 feet long and 24 feet tall arch bridge. The process took about 1.5 weeks to build. However, it took a total of 9 months to plan and acquire the proper paperwork.
