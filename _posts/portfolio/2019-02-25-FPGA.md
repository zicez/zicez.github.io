2.70 Precision Machine Design Spring 2019. 

In this class, we are to make a new device biweekly to demonstrate a particular fundametal theory of design. These devices are called FPGA - FUNdaMENTAL Principle Gizmo Assignments. The goal is to do the math to predict its performance and then build it. Along with my partner, Chetan Sharma, we created six FPGAs in this class. 

#### FPGA 1: Preload
### Finicky Preload with Great Applications
In this week FPGA, we wanted to demonstrate how you can create a locknut by using two nuts. This is accomplished by taking two nuts and tightening (preloading) it together.

We wanted to see how much torque this artificial locknut can resist. We created an analytical model to predict its performance.

We then created a matlab script to do this calculation for us.

% Put in equations form

    strain = ((final - original)/original)/2;
    E = 190 * 10^9;
    stress = strain*E;
    force = stress * A;
end
function torque = computeTorque(preload)
    u = 0.5;
    r = 1/8 * 0.0254;
    torque = preload*sind(75)*u*r;

The actual device that we built is a jig that hold the two preloaded nuts together, so we can test it resistance to torque with a mini Instron machine.

Our mathematical model could predict the preloaded nut if we use a spring washer in between the buts. However, if we just smash two nuts together, the mechanic becomes more complicated as we have to account for the uneven tensioning of the threads.

| Trial 1 (Spring Washer 180o)
Preload = 152.4 N
Finput predict = 2.33 N 
Finput actual = 3 N |

| Trial 2 (Spring Washer 360o)
Preload = 304.8 N
Finput predict = 4.67 N
Finput actual  = 4.5 N

| Trial 3 (Smashing Nuts 10o)
Preload = 19699 N
Finput predict = 151.1 N 
Finput actual  = 72 N |
