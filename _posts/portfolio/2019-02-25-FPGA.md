2.70 Precision Machine Design Spring 2019. 

In this class, we are to make a new device biweekly to demonstrate a particular fundametal theory of design. These devices are called FPGA - FUNdaMENTAL Principle Gizmo Assignments. The goal is to do the math to predict its performance and then build it. Along with my partner, Chetan Sharma, we created six FPGAs in this class. 

### FPGA 1: Preload
#### Finicky Preload with Great Applications
In this week FPGA, we wanted to demonstrate how you can create a locknut by using two nuts. This is accomplished by taking two nuts and tightening (preloading) it together. 

<img alt="fpga1_1" src="/images/fpga/fpga1/Preload.jpg">

We wanted to see how much torque this artificial locknut can resist. We created an analytical model to predict its performance.

|<img alt="fpga1_math1" src="/images/fpga/fpga1/math1.PNG">|<img alt="fpga1_math2" src="/images/fpga/fpga1/math2.PNG">|

We then created a matlab script to do this calculation for us.

The actual device that we built is a jig that hold the two preloaded nuts together, so we can test it resistance to torque with a mini Instron machine.

|<img alt="fpga1_math3" src="/images/fpga/fpga1/jig.jpg">|<img alt="fpga1_math4" src="/images/fpga/fpga1/test_jig.jpg">|

Our mathematical model could predict the preloaded nut if we use a spring washer in between the buts. However, if we just smash two nuts together, the mechanic becomes more complicated as we have to account for the uneven tensioning of the threads.

Trial 1 (Spring Washer 180 deg)
Preload = 152.4 N
Finput predict = 2.33 N 
Finput actual = 3 N

<img alt="fpga1_2" src="/images/fpga/fpga1/preload_180deg.PNG">

Trial 2 (Spring Washer 360 deg)
Preload = 304.8 N
Finput predict = 4.67 N
Finput actual  = 4.5 N 


<img alt="fpga1_3" src="/images/fpga/fpga1/preload_360deg.PNG">

Trial 3 (Smashing Nuts 10 deg)
Preload = 19699 N
Finput predict = 151.1 N 
Finput actual  = 72 N

### FPGA 2: St. Venant, Golden Rectangle, Stability
#### Figure Pondering Grading of Assignment

In this FPGA, we wanted to create the most satisfying switch possible. The semi-bistable switch we created demonstrate the fundamental design of stability.

In order to create the clicking sound, we made an elastic system with hysteresis. The crank is stable in one position during the full travel of the button and only changes to another stable position at the end of the buttonâ€™s travel.  

|<img alt="fpga2_1" src="/images/fpga/fpga2/state1.jpg">|<img alt="fpga2_2" src="/images/fpga/fpga2/state2.jpg">| <img alt="fpga2_3" src="/images/fpga/fpga2/state3.jpg">|

This behavior is calculated using a python script. The script describe the energy stored in system as the button is being pressed. As the system has hysterisis, it will switch from one state to another and releasing the stored energy.

Mathematically, it seems to work, so we set out to design it. Here is a sketch of our intial design alongside with the final CAD 

|<img alt="fpga2_concept" src="/images/fpga/fpga2/concept.jpg">|<img alt="fpga2_cad" src="/images/fpga/fpga2/cad3.jpg">|

Here's a GIF of our device working.
<img alt="fpga2_device" src="/images/fpga/fpga2/device.gif">

Through our model, we predicted a hysteresis of 4.7 mm, but we ended up seeing an actualy hysteresis of 5.6 mm. 

### FPGA 3: Abbe'S Principle; Accuracy, Repeatability, Resolution; Sensitive Directions & Reference Features
#### Flexures Put in Ghastly Applications

We wanted to do something that will demonstrate sensitive direction on a flexure. So, for this FPGA, we waterjet a flexure and then machined pockets on the flexure. This is normally a terrible idea, but for science, let's break some end mill. 

The setup for our FPGA is like this

<img alt="fpga3_setup" src="/images/fpga/fpga3/Setup.png">

Let's calculate the stiffness of this flexure in the two directions. This done using FEA in SolidWorks.

|<img alt="fpga3_sensitive" src="/images/fpga/fpga3/Sensitive.png">|<img alt="fpga3_nonsen" src="/images/fpga/fpga3/non-sen.png">|

Next, let's figure out the cutting forces involved in pocketing out a hole. Using the machinery handbook, a spreadsheet is created to calculated the forces. Thank you to Julian Leland from Swartmroe College for providing the initial template for this spreadsheet.

<img alt="fpga3_math" src="/images/fpga/fpga3/math.png">

Using this we predict a variation of 0.08 mm on the finished in one surface of the pocket and not on the other.

<img alt="fpga3_prediction" src="/images/fpga/fpga3/Prediction.png">

It actually took a lot of work to get this shitty setup to work on the CNC machine. There was so much vibration from the work piece that we basically either started friction welding or just breaking end mills. In the end, a lot of finickying around with the settings and many many flood coolant got us some result. 

|<img alt="fpga3_shit" src="/images/fpga/fpga3/shit.jpg">|<img alt="fpga3_notshit" src="/images/fpga/fpga3/notshit.jpg">|

The result is pretty close to what we expected. The deflection along the sensitie axis resulted in each corresponding face being shrunk by 0.075 mm compared to our 0.08 mm prediction. On the other hand, the other axis is not as affected. The pocketed hole supposed to have a dimension of 40x40 mm.

### FPGA 4: Centers of Action, Symmetry, Reciprocity
#### Freaky Pulleys Going Axially

In this FPGA, we wanted to design something to demonstrate reciprocity. The idea is to create a straight virtue rail using strings and two pulleys. This is pretty hard to explain in words, so let's look at diagram of it first. 

<img alt="fpga4_diagram" src="/images/fpga/fpga4/diagram.png">

The two pulleys have string wound up in it, and at its end, a mass is attached. The rate at which the pulley take in or release string is carefully calculated such that the attached mass will only move horizontally. The math is just some basic differential equations. Th

<img alt="fpga4_math" src="/images/fpga/fpga4/math.png">

Then we used a python script to generate the basic shape of the pulley. The script generate a path of the continuously changing pulley's radius. This path is exported to a file and then used by SolidWorks to CAD the pulley.

The device then is mounted on an aluminum plate. 

<img alt="fpga4_device" src="/images/fpga/fpga4/device.jpg">

Here's a GIF of the device working. 

<img alt="fpga4_gif" src="/images/fpga/fpga4/gif.gif">

We expected the device to move in a straight line, but out of the three prototypes we built, none of them could move perfectly in a straight line. This is probably due to that fact that the device is extremely sensitive to initial condiction. The mass must be attached at exactly the right length of string with the respect to each of the two pulleys. This is really hard to do manually by hand. A better method must be developed to this last step. Additionally, more second order effects must be considered to get a better straight line.

### FPGA 5: Parallel Axis Theorem, Structural Loops
#### Figure Pulling Great mAss

Do you know about the phenomenom where a spinning ice skater will pull their arms inward to spin even faster? We essentially wanted to make a device that does this to demonstrate Parallel Axis Theorem. The FPGA is a flywheel that has a changing moment of inertia (think mechanical tetherball). A sketch of the final concept can be seen below. 

<img alt="fpga5_concept" src="/images/fpga/fpga5/concept.png">

To mathematically analyse this system, we derived an equation of motion using Legrangian Mechanics. This method works by writing the equation of energy of the system and taking derivative. Simple enough........ Actually, it's not simple at all. The model works to conserve energy well enough, but as you add a generalized force to change the moment of inertia of the system. I get infinite energy. Additionally, I didn't have quite enough time to add in non-conservative forces (friction) to the model. The math here just shows that the concept works, but it doesn't actually do that good of a job describing the device. I will try to redo this if I have more time. 

<img alt="fpga5_math" src="/images/fpga/fpga5/math.jpg">

Below is the code I wrote in Matlab to derive the equation of motion and do a dynamic simulation with ODE45.

Here's a GIF of the dynamic simulation.

Next, we CAD the device with SolidWorks.

<img alt="fpga5_cad" src="/images/fpga/fpga5/FPGA.png">

Then we made the thing! It was very simple to make. It's just a few waterjetted parts. For each device, we only had to pocket 2 holes to fit the bearings. This didn't take that long at all to make. Here's a nice photo of the device on my awesome rug. 

<img alt="fpga5_device" src="/images/fpga/fpga5/thumbnail.jpg">

Next, we wanted to actually measure the device if it was actually speeding up or slowing down. Here's a GIF of the device spinning in both directions.

The change in angular velocity is so very subtle. We should have going with a way heavier moving mass. Well, that didn't deter us. Let's pull out a frame checking softward. I highly recommend using Tracker. It's super useful to doing frame by frame analysis of a a video. Using this software, we can track the exact movement of the moving mass frame by frame.

<img alt="fpga5_tracker" src="/images/fpga/fpga5/tracker.PNG">

Here's the plot of the collected data. If you stare at it hard enough, you can see that the angular velocity stays roughly constant even with friction when the mass is moving inward. On the other hand, the device spins much slower as the mass is moving outward.

### FPGA 6: Exact Constraint, Elastically Averaged
#### Friendly Precise Gadget Alignment

For this FPGA, we built a kinematic coupling to demonstrate the power of exact constraint. A kinematic coupling allows two objects to mate together in the exact same position everytime it taken apart and put together down to nanometer accuracy. It works by constraining the six degrees of freedom that any object has. If you touch an object at the same 6 spots everytime, then the object will orient in the same position everytime. A kinematic coupling does this using 3 balls and 3 v-grooves. For this project, we take this one step further. One one plate, we have 4 orientations on one plate with one orientation every 90 degrees. The v-grooves are offset such that simple rotation can only result in four unique positions. 

This diagram below shows the four unique orientations that the 3 v-grooves orient.

<img alt="fpga6_orientations" src="/images/fpga/fpga6/bottom_edit.png">

The device is two plates -- one with grooves and one with balls.

|<img alt="fpga6_top" src="/images/fpga/fpga6/Top.png">|<img alt="fpga6_bottom" src="/images/fpga/fpga6/bottom.png">|

The device is manufactured using a CNC mill. The balls are press-fit in place.

We attempted to measure how good the repeatability of the device, but it was way too good to do. We mounted a laser on the device and shine it to a spot 126 feet away. Then repeatedly uncoupled and coupled the two plates together.
