2.70 Precision Machine Design Spring 2019. In this class, we are to make a new device biweekly to demonstrate a particular fundametal theory of design. These devices are called FPGA - FUNdaMENTAL Principle Gizmo Assignments. The goal is to do the math to predict its performance and then build it. Along with my partner, Chetan Sharma, we created six FPGAs in this class. 

#### FPGA 1: Preload
### Finicky Preload with Great Applications
In this week FPGA, we wanted to demonstrate how you can create a locknut by using two nuts. This is accomplished by taking two nuts and tightening (preloading) it together.

We wanted to see how much torque this artificial locknut can resist. We created an analytical model to predict its performance.
