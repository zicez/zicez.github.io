My name is Thanh Nha Nguyen. I was born in Vietnam and emmigrated to the US when I was nine. I graduated from MIT class of 2019 in Mechanical Engineering.

I love making things. There's just something magical about putting things together into a coherent functional object. With a more diverse skillset, more interesting things can be made, so I ended up learning across many disciplines - structural engineering, analog electronics, firmware design, and controls theory.

I'm currently pursuing a PhD degree at MIT in Mechanical Engineering. I'm hoping to pick up more skills along the way.
